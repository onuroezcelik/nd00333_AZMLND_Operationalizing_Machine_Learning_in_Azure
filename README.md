# Operationalizing Machine Learning

In this project, a cloud-based machine learning production model is configured, deployed, and consumed in Azure. Furthermore a pipeline is created, published, and consumed.
A bank marketing dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing is used for the model training.

## Architectural Diagram
The following steps are performed:

1. Authentication
2. Automated ML Experiment
3. Deploy the best model
4. Enable logging
5. Swagger Documentation
6. Consume model endpoints
7. Create and publish a pipeline
8. Documentation

*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

1. Authentication
The lab Udacity is used to complete the project. Therefore this step is skipped since I am not authorized to create a security principal. 

2. Automated ML Experiment
Azure Machine Learning GUI is used to create a new automated ML run.
Experiment name is defined at the step of "Basic Settings"

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
